This repository contains the code used in the experiments for the following paper:

A. Cropper, A. Tamaddoni-Nezhad, , and S.H. Muggleton. Meta-interpretive learning of data transformation programs. ILP2015. Under review.

We used YAP 6.3.4 in all experiments.

To reproduce the XML, ecological, and medical results in Figs. 6, 9, and 11 respectively, go to the respective subdirectory and run the run.bash files. The associated learned programs and experimental results are stored in the folder 'results-2'.

Use the the results.py file in each subdirectory to generate the output for the Figs.

Contact a.cropper13@imperial.ac.uk with any queries.
